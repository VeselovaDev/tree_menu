# Tree Menu Project

Tree Menu is a Django app for creating and managing hierarchical menus stored in the database. Menus are easily editable through Djangoâ€™s standard admin interface, rendered on any page via a custom template tag, and support nested items that automatically expand based on the current URL.

## Key Features

- Menus and menu items are stored in the database.

- Menu management via standard Django admin interface.

- Display menus on any page using a template tag by menu name.

- Active menu item is determined by the current page URL.

- Parent items and the first-level children under the active item are expanded.

- Support multiple menus on the same page.

- Only one database query needed per menu rendering.

- Menu item URLs can be set either explicitly or via Django named URLs.
